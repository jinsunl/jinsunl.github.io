I am a Postdoc Researcher in the [Robotics Department](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
Currently I am part of the Robotics and Optimization for the Analysis of Human Motion ([ROAHM](http://www.roahmlab.com/)) Lab advised by [Prof. Ram Vasudevan](http://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal), and am working on real-time motion planing in determistic and uncertain environments using reachability analysis. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Robotics and M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) both from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
Prior to that, I reveiced my B.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/college/departments/department-electrical-and-computer-engineering) advised by [Prof. Andrew Lamperski](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/andrew-lamperski).
I also hold another B.E. in Electrical Engineering from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.ee.bjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests are in Robotics, Motion Planning, and Optimization.


<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
